3.1 Release Notes
=================

3.1.0
-----
Manifest List upload is now supported. To upload a JSON Manifest List,
all V2 Image Manifests referenced in the Manifest List must already be in Pulp
and associated to the target repository.

Docker image V2 schema version 2 upload is now supported. To accomplish this, you need to install
skopeo binaries on your machine and then to create an on-disk representation of
your docker image you can use ``skopeo copy`` command. See https://github.com/projectatomic/skopeo#copying-images
for more details. Before uploading, you need to tar the contents of the directory created by ``skopeo copy``.

Support for image manifest V1 and V2 schema version 1 did not change.

3.1.1
-----
The unit key for an uploaded unit is now present in the ``details`` field of
the task's body, and is queriable via the REST API.
