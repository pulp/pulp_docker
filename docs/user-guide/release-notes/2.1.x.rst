2.1 Release Notes
=================

2.1.0
-----

See the :fixedbugs_pulp_docker:`2.1.0`.

We have added new options ``--basicauth-user`` and ``--basicauth-password`` when creating or updating
repositories. These options allow the user to sync private repositories from Docker registries that
support basic authentication.
