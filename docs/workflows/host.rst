Host and Consume a Docker Repository 
====================================

This section assumes that you have a repository with content in it. To do this, see the
:doc:`sync` documentation.

Create a Docker Distribution to serve your Repository Version
-------------------------------------------------------------

Docker Distributions can be used to serve the Docker registry API
containing the content in a repository's latest version or a specified
repository version. 

.. literalinclude:: ../_scripts/distribution.sh
   :language: bash

Response:

.. code::

    {
        "_created": "2019-09-05T14:29:51.742086Z",
        "_href": "/pulp/api/v3/distributions/docker/docker/1b461dac-0839-4049-aa8f-92f8e8f7f034/",
        "base_path": "test",
        "content_guard": null,
        "name": "testing-hello",
        "registry_path": "localhost:24816/test",
        "repository": "/pulp/api/v3/repositories/fcf03266-f0e4-4497-8434-0fe9d94c8053/",
        "repository_version": null
    }



Reference: `Docker Distribution Usage <../restapi.html#tag/distributions>`_

Pull and run an image from Pulp
-------------------------------

Once a distribution is configured to host a repository with Docker
images in it, that content can be consumed by container clients.

Podman
^^^^^^

``$ podman pull localhost:24816/foo``

If SSL has not been setup for your Pulp, configure podman to work with the insecure registry:

Edit the file ``/etc/containers/registries.conf.`` and add::

    [registries.insecure]
    registries = ['localhost:24816']

https://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2018/05/podman-tls/

Docker
^^^^^^

If SSL has not been setup for your Pulp, configure docker to work with the insecure registry:

Edit the file ``/etc/docker/daemon.json`` and add::

    {
        "insecure-registries" : ["localhost:24816"]

    }

.. literalinclude:: ../_scripts/download_after_sync.sh
   :language: bash
   
Docker Output::

    Hello from Docker!
    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
    
    To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
     1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
     2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
        (amd64)
     3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
        executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
     4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
        to your terminal.
    
    To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
     $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
