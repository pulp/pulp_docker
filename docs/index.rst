pulp-docker Plugin
==================

The ``pulp_docker`` plugin extends `pulpcore <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulpcore/>`__ to support
hosting Docker images. This plugin is a part of the `Pulp Project <http://www.pulpproject.org>`_,
and assumes some familiarity with the `pulpcore documentation
<https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/3.0/nightly/>`_.

If you are just getting started, we recommend getting to know the :doc:`basic
workflows<workflows/index>`.

Community contributions are encouraged.

* View and file issues in the `Redmine Tracker
  <https://pulp.plan.io/projects/pulp_docker/issues>`_.
